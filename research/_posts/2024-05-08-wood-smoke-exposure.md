Air pollution is an emerging risk factor for NSCLC and its recurrence: high PM2.5 and wildfire smoke exposures are associated with reduced survival and reduced lung function following NSCLC surgical resection. Air pollution is increasingly concerning due to ongoing indoor wood burning and an escalating number of catastrophic wildfires. Emitted wood smoke (WS) from wildfires can travel miles and impact individuals across North America. As such, there is an urgent need to understand the adverse effects of WS and develop approaches to mitigate the effects of WS to prevent lung cancer and its recurrence. This project involves performing controlled wood smoke exposure experiments on lung cells and multi-omic profiling to identify disrupted genes and pathways. Particular arms of the study will also include molecular interventions to study if the effects of WS can be mitigated.
